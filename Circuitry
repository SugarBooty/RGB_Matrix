The LED rows are driven by shift registers, 
the clock pin is 6, 
the data pin is 4, 
The clear pin is 5.
Theres 8 LEDs per row, RGB, so 8x3 (24) values 
that need to be shifted in

You switch from the first collumn to the next with a pulse 
to the decade counter (4017). 
The clock pin is 8 and the reset pin is 7

You should reset the 4017 in the beginning to
make sure its on the correct collumn, 
as it starts on a random one

I think the display reset pin blanks it? 
I genuinely have no idea what it does. 
Its pin 9, whatever it is
